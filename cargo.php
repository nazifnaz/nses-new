                <p>Experience counts when it comes to handling complex projects and movement of oversized and heavy-lift
                    cargoes. Managing complex transportation for large scale projects requires experienced, intelligent
                    and knowledgeable personnel who are committed to researching all options, surveying, potential
                    problems, physical and non-physical obstacles and reacting to extraordinary circumstances with quick
                    and decisive actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our approach is to break down project logistics and transport into essential elements, and then to
                    assign direct supervision over each. Advance trips by our Projects Operations Specialist to the key
                    points in the project corridor ensure that we have the first-hand knowledge required to “make things
                    happen”. A Project Coordinator is then assigned to manage all facets of communication, logistics and
                    transportation operations and becomes the direct liaison to enable smooth operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The success of our project logistics lies in its commitment to understanding what is required. Our
                    specialist advisers become fully conversant with the requirements of a project and ensure that
                    customer-specified deadlines, HSE aspects and special instructions are strictly adhered to. We
                    specialize in project freight management and all associated planning and implementation services.
                    Whether you are moving an individual heavy lift or complete industrial plant from various origins
                    around the world to remote construction sites, we arrange for customized transportation concepts for
                    the entire route on a door to door basis.
